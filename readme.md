# Fractals
In this project, I simulate some well-known fractals using both deterministic and random approaches. Fractals are patterns that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. For the deterministic algorithms, I start with a line segment defined by two points. At each iteration, I apply a different transformation to these points to create a more complex shape.
### Koch snowflake
For this fractal, the mapping function is


### Heighway dragon



### Sierpi≈Ñski triangle

## Barnsley Fern
Some fractals can be generated by repeatedly applying random transformations that are characteristic of the fractal. If enough sample points are used, and enough iterations are performed so that the smallest unit of the shape is smaller than a pixel of the display, the fractal will be rendered accurately. I simulated the Barnsley Fern using this approach. The Barnsley Fern is a fractal that resembles a natural fern. It is defined by four affine transformations that are applied randomly to each point with different probabilities.

## Julia Set
Julia set is a set of complex numbers which do not converge to any limit when a given mapping is repeatedly applied to them.
Some of them produce beautiful and complex fractals. Here, I write c = -0.4 + 0.6i and c = -i.
