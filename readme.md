# Fractals
In this assignment we simulate some prominent fractals with determinstic and random approach.
 Fractals are self-similar patterns. My approach for deterministic algorithms is to consider a line, described by two points.
At each step, these points exposed to different mapping.
### Koch snowflake
For this fractal, the mapping function is


### Heighway dragon



### Sierpi≈Ñski triangle


Some fractals can be generated by repeatedly applying random transformations from the fractal. If this is done with enough
sample points, and enough steps so that the smallest unit of the shape is smaller than a pixel of the display, the fractal will be perfect.
I simulated Barnsley Fern with this approach.

## Julia Set
Julia set is a set of complex numbers which do not converge to any limit when a given mapping is repeatedly applied to them.
Some of them produce beautiful and complex fractals. Here, I write c = -0.4 + 0.6i and c = -i.
